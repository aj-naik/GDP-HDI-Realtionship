# GDP-HDI-Realtionship
A data visualization project for determining the relationship if any between GDP per Capita of a country and its HDI score.

This project was done as a capstone project for Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python course on coursera in July 2020. 

# Datasets Info
2 datasets are used for this project:-
- GDP per Capita of countries across the world over a period of decades.
- HDI Score of countries across the world over a period of decades.

Datasets were obtained from World Bank and Kaggle.

# Project Description
The notebook contains plots outlining relationship between GDP per capita and HDI of countries. Plots of countries individually and single plot for all countries are also generated.

# Project Features
- Both interactive and static plots are generated
- Comparisions can be done for 4 countries
- Separate Plots to track change in GDP per capita and HDI of a country across the years

# Inference 
A change in GDP per capita of a country is highly related to its HDI score. 

From the plots we can understand that an increase in GDP per capita meaning an increase in average income of people of a country will provide overall better lifestyle to the people giving them better access to resources, healthcare, education, etc which in turn will lead to a high HDI score for the country. The opposite also holds true i.e. Countires with lower GDP per capita will have a lower HDI score.

# Improvements to be done
- Optimise code so that any number of countries can be selected instead of current limit of 4.
- Refactor code by creating functions for plot generation to avoid repetition of code. This will lead to optimisation of code and reduction in size of code and will make the code portable.
- Create dashboard for the project.
